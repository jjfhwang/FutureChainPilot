# FutureChainPilot: Streamlining Blockchain Integration with TypeScript

FutureChainPilot is a lightweight, TypeScript-based framework designed to simplify the integration of applications with various blockchain platforms. It abstracts away the complexities of interacting directly with blockchain nodes, allowing developers to focus on building the core logic of their applications without getting bogged down in low-level details. This framework aims to provide a consistent and intuitive API for common blockchain operations, fostering rapid development and reducing the learning curve associated with blockchain technologies.

This project addresses the growing need for efficient and accessible blockchain integration tools. Many developers find themselves spending excessive time wrestling with intricate blockchain protocols and SDKs. FutureChainPilot offers a solution by providing a standardized set of interfaces and utilities for interacting with different blockchain networks. It emphasizes type safety through its TypeScript implementation, minimizing runtime errors and improving code maintainability. By providing pre-built components for common tasks such as transaction creation, signing, and broadcasting, FutureChainPilot empowers developers to build blockchain-enabled applications faster and with greater confidence.

FutureChainPilot goes beyond simply wrapping existing blockchain APIs. It introduces a modular architecture that allows developers to easily extend and customize the framework to meet their specific needs. This flexibility is crucial in the rapidly evolving blockchain landscape where new technologies and protocols emerge constantly. The framework includes comprehensive documentation and examples to guide developers through the integration process. The goal is to provide a powerful yet approachable tool that can be used by both experienced blockchain developers and those new to the technology.

## Key Features

*   **Blockchain Agnostic Abstraction:** Provides a unified interface for interacting with different blockchain networks. Currently supporting Ethereum (via ethers.js) and Solana (via @solana/web3.js), with plans to expand to other blockchains in the future. Each blockchain implementation is encapsulated within a module allowing for easy addition or removal.

*   **Type-Safe Transaction Management:** Leverages TypeScript's type system to ensure transaction data is validated before being submitted to the blockchain. Includes pre-defined data structures for common transaction types, reducing the risk of errors. Example: `interface EthereumTransactionData { to: string; value: string; gasLimit: number; }`

*   **Simplified Wallet Integration:** Offers a simple API for integrating with various wallet providers, such as MetaMask and Phantom. Handles the complexities of wallet connection, account management, and transaction signing. This integration utilizes asynchronous functions to handle user interactions with the wallets.

*   **Event Subscription and Filtering:** Allows developers to subscribe to specific blockchain events and filter them based on predefined criteria. This is achieved by utilizing blockchain-specific event polling and filtering methodologies. This feature is crucial for building real-time applications that react to blockchain activity. Example: `futureChainPilot.subscribeToEvent('Transfer', { from: '0x...', to: '0x...' }, (eventData) => { console.log('Transfer event:', eventData); });`

*   **Gas Estimation and Optimization:** Provides utilities for estimating the gas cost of transactions and optimizing gas usage to minimize transaction fees. It utilizes blockchain-specific RPC methods for gas estimation.

*   **Modular Architecture:** Designed with a modular architecture that allows developers to easily extend and customize the framework to meet their specific needs. New blockchain integrations can be added by implementing a specific interface.

*   **Comprehensive Logging and Error Handling:** Includes robust logging and error handling mechanisms to facilitate debugging and troubleshooting. Uses a centralized logging service that can be configured to output to various destinations (e.g., console, file, remote server).

## Technology Stack

*   **TypeScript:** Provides type safety and improved code maintainability.
*   **ethers.js:** A comprehensive Ethereum library used for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
*   **@solana/web3.js:** A JavaScript/TypeScript library for interacting with the Solana blockchain.
*   **Node.js:** The runtime environment for executing the TypeScript code.
*   **npm/yarn:** Package managers for managing dependencies.

## Installation

1.  Ensure you have Node.js (version 16 or higher) and npm/yarn installed.
2.  Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/FutureChainPilot.git
3.  Navigate to the project directory:
    cd FutureChainPilot
4.  Install the dependencies using npm:
    npm install
    or using yarn:
    yarn install

## Configuration

The framework relies on environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and define the following variables:

*   `ETHEREUM_NODE_URL`: The URL of the Ethereum node to connect to (e.g., Infura, Alchemy). Example: `ETHEREUM_NODE_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/<YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID>`
*   `SOLANA_NODE_URL`: The URL of the Solana node to connect to (e.g., a local validator, a public RPC endpoint). Example: `SOLANA_NODE_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`
*   `LOG_LEVEL`: The logging level (e.g., debug, info, warn, error). Example: `LOG_LEVEL=info`

You can load these environment variables in your application using a library like `dotenv`.

## Usage

First, initialize the `FutureChainPilot` with the appropriate blockchain network.
